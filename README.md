 Plant Growth & Analysis System
This project is a **web-based application** designed to analyze and track **plant growth** using **HTML, CSS, PyTorch, and MySQL** for database management. It helps users monitor plant health, predict growth stages, and store analysis data.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (for UI and styling)  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI to handle requests)  
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch (for growth prediction and analysis)  
- **Database:** MySQL (to store plant data and growth records)  
- **Deployment:** Cloud hosting (AWS, DigitalOcean, or Firebase)

## **Project Features**  

### **1. Image-Based Plant Growth Prediction**  
- Users can upload plant images for analysis.  
- PyTorch model predicts the plant's **growth stage** and **expected development**.  

### **2. Plant Health Monitoring**  
- Detects plant conditions (healthy, under-watered, nutrient deficiency, etc.).  
- Suggests corrective actions based on the analysis.  

### **3. Growth Data Storage (MySQL Integration)**  
- Stores uploaded images and analysis results.  
- Tracks plant growth over time with timestamps.  

### **4. User Dashboard**  
- View past plant growth reports and predictions.  
- Compare multiple plants' growth progress.  

### **5. Admin Panel (Optional)**  
- Manage plant data, predictions, and system configurations.

## **Database Design (MySQL Schema)**  

### **Tables:**  
1. **Users** â†’ Stores user login details.  
2. **Plants** â†’ Stores plant species and descriptions.  
3. **Growth_Records** â†’ Stores plant images, predicted growth stages, and timestamps.  
4. **Health_Analysis** â†’ Stores health predictions and recommendations.  

---

## **Workflow**  
1. **User uploads a plant image** â†’ The image is processed by the PyTorch model.  
2. **Model predicts growth stage and health status** â†’ Results are displayed.  
3. **Data is stored in MySQL** â†’ Users can track progress over time.  
4. **User can access past records** to compare plant growth.

### **Next Steps**  
- Do you need real-time image capture from a camera?  
- Should I help with the PyTorch model for growth prediction?  
- Do you want a fully designed database schema for MySQL?
